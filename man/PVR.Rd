\arguments{
\item{traits}{Species described by continuous traits, with traits as columns 
and species as rows.}

\item{cumulative}{Percentage of variation in the phylogenetic distances 
considered in the analysis. Cumulative percentage must be higher than the 
cumulative percentage of the first two eigenvalues, and less than 1.}

the specified value).}

check Logical argument (TRUE or FALSE) that checks  whether traits and phylogeny
taxa labels match. The sequence of species in the trait data must be the same as 
that in the phylogenetic distance matrix.}

\item{check}{Logical argument (TRUE or FALSE) to check if species sequence in the traits data
follows the same order as the one in the phylodist matrices (Default checkdata = TRUE).}

\description{
Phylogenetic Eigenvector Regression (PVR) and eigenvector selection.
}
\details{
This function is based on a non-sequential approach, that uses the combination
of eigenvectors that minimizes the residual phylogenetic autocorrelation, 
measured by Moran I. The method can be used to measure the level of 
phylogenetic signal in ecological data and to study correlated evolution
(Diniz-Filho et al 2011).

The phylogenetic distance matrix is double-centered and submitted to principal
coordinates analysis (PCoA). This method generates orthogonal eigenvectors that
summarize the phylogenetic structure (Diniz-Filho et al 2008).

The sets of eigenvectors is selected with multiple regression model:

Y = a+Xb+e

where Y is a vector describing trait variation in the set of species, X contains
a set of k eigenvectors, a the intercept, b is the vector with regression coefficients estimated 
and e its residuals, the part of variation in Y that is not explained by the 
X (Diniz-Filho et al 1998). 

The function use an iterative search for the eigenvector that reduces the autocorrelation
in the residuals. Primarily, the regression for all eigenvectors is calculated, obtaining
the residuas. Then, Moran I for each eigenvector is calculated for the residuals. The 
function select the eingenvector with the lowest Moran I, and then, as new eigenvectors 
are added to the model, residuals are updated and autocorrelation is reestimated. The search
stops when residual autocorrelation is reduced below threshold Moran I specified and when 
the statistical significance is reached (Diniz-Filho et al 2011).

\note{
The parameter in minimun.moran is shown as follows y ~  x[,3] + x[,5], 
in other words Trait~Axis_3+Axis_5 and so on.
