Description: Set of functions for analysis of ecological and evolutionary
    data. These functions calculate Phylogenetic Eigenvector Regression (PVR)
    with eigenvector selection, extract residuals from Mantel test, generate
    Linear Models (LM) with all possible combinations of variables included in
    the full model, show information about a label in a phylogenetic tree, makes
    node labels, add species in a phylogenetic tree, organize a list in a single
    matrix, compact a phylogenetic tree, define graphical parameters to plot 
    phylogenetic tree, plot phylogenetic tree with nodes collapsed and extract 
    details of information criterion. The functions are available as an R package 
    only to facilitate installation.
